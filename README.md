### About
A project aimed at bridging gap between Hospitals and local PPE manufacturers.
The other objectives of this project include:
- encourage "Make in India" especially through local production
- raise revenue to boost national economy
- reduce human effort
- provide a quick supply of essential items to hospitals in these tough pandemic times
### Problem Statement
In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals have registered a shortage of necessary equipment due to lack of production and unequal distribution of the same. So, our platform gives incentives for new players to arrive in the market by making it profit-driven. It thus solves the problem of shortage of equipment and services. Also, we believe that the project will aid into increasing awareness on COVID-19 in addition to providing real-time statistics of the same. So, we believe the project is useful to doctors, businessmen, local population who shall earn employment as delivery people and manufacturing process workers as medical sector expands, thereby supporting local population and reducing unemployment. 
Thus, in short, our project is about increasing resource deployment efficiency by providing a pull supply chain mechanism, trying to eliminate shortage of medical goods in the industry, increase public availability of information and thus increasing awareness - all this in a profit-driven business model.
